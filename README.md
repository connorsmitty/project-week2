# project-week2

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a portfolio website that will showcase our work from this course as time goes on. We will implement updates and change styling as we obtain new information and skills.

For this task I created a responsive website that can be suitable for mobile applications as well as follows the basic requirements given to us by our instuctors. For this application all the links work as well as the layout is functioning and appealing as an interface.
